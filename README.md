# Stray Signal

Welcome! This is the shared space for all my projects, experiments, and tech tools. Most of these were born from scratching my own itch --  just trying out an idea that seemed fun or useful at the time.

## Whoâ€™s Behind This?

Run by [lupomancer](https://github.com/lupomancer) -- IT tech by day, werewolf by night.
I work out of Vancouver, BC, mostly doing infrastructure work: M365, Azure AD, VoIP, NAS, scripting, migrations, all that good stuff.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- DIY tools for automation
- Self-hosting and helpers
- Small scripts or helpers (e.g. [fediverse-radar](https://github.com/StraySignal/fediverse-radar), a CLI for sorting your social graph)

Most repos are solo-built, not polished products; theyâ€™re made for my own use but may help others in similar roles.

## Philosophy

- SOMETHINGS THINGS WILL SUCK and that's okay :)
- If itâ€™s here, it solved something real for me (or is in the process of being something that will)  
- Happy to take feedback or PRs, but do note I'm learning most of this as I go and I'm way out of my depth on a lot of these projects. So BE NICE thx

## Getting Started

Each repo has its own README with setup details. Issues and PRs are open -- just read the notes first so we're on the same page about what a project *is* (and isn't) trying to do.

## Contact

If you need to reach me, open an issue or check my GitHub profile for contact info.
